Banner files must follow the naming convention `<resource-type>-<banner-type>-<featured>-<from>-<till>.json` where:

- `<resource-type>` is the type of the featured resource (e.g. 'Resonator', 'Weapon')
- `<banner-type>` is the type of the banner (e.g. 'Standard', 'Event')
- `<featured>` is 'featured' if the banner features a specific resource, or the first featured resource if the banner features multiple resources.
- `<from>` is the start date of the banner in the format 'YYYYMMDD'
- `<till>` is the end date of the banner in the format 'YYYYMMDD'
